Worth noting this key is required for ingress Disaster recovery key \u00b6 k10 Disaster recovery can be enabled in settings -> K10 Disaster Recovery in the UI. When you enabled this, you will be asked for a passphrase, and given a cluster id. Doing a full DR from a clean install requires the passphrase placed in a secret before install. I chose to put this in a SOPS secret which is loaded with the k10 helmrelease, so it is always on my cluster ready to go. I also put the clusterID in the secret - k10 does not need it, but its there ready to go in a easy to find spot.

Restoring a pvc \u00b6 The general workflow for a gitops cluster can be described as: Scale down relevant deployments to 0 (To release the pvc's) In k10 UI, select the desired backup in the Applications section Select 'Data-only restore' (this only restores the pvc data and no configuration) Check progress of restore in dashboard Scale up deployment Disaster recovery \u00b6 Learn from my mistakes Im writing this because I force-deleted a kustomization, which led to my entire cluster being wiped. k10 saved my rear end and the DR worked fine. Be careful deleting kustomizations! Read the docs The k10 docs provide what is needed here https://docs.kasten.io/latest/operating/dr.html As long as a DR policy is activated, the passphrase and clusterId has been retained - recovery is easy and safe. To recover, I bootstrap the cluster as fresh and let everything come up. This brings up everything, as well as a blank k10. This also installs the required secret k10-dr-secret as noted in 'Specifying a DR Passphrase' in the above link. Then we can run the disaster recovery helm install, checking and replacing in below the namespace, clusterID and profile name (likely k10-disaster-recovery-policy ) Install the helm chart that creates the K10 restore job and wait for completion of the `k10-restore` job Assumes that K10 is installed in 'kasten-io' namespace. helm install k10-restore kasten/k10restore --namespace=kasten-io \\ --set sourceClusterID=<source-clusterID> \\ --set profile.name=<location-profile-name> Ensure k10 is up to date Ensure k10 is up to date - having a older version and then installing the latest DR helm can lead to funky, yet undesired results.

While many use generic names for servers & clusters, aligning to the 'servers are not pets' doctorine that tools like k8's bring, I still need to get my nerd on with a personal cluster. I got the idea for Hegira from Dan Simmons Hyperion Cantos . It ties into the naming of the sidero cluster (technocore) and in general the theme of AI & Humanity that is portraied in the books Hegira is also defined as a journey especially when undertaken to escape from a dangerous or undesirable situation , a somewhat medieval Latin translation of an Arabic word that can be translated to 'migration' or 'exodus', which actually somewhat fits the journey my homelab has taken over the years. K8s folder structure - App Manifests \u00b6 This lists the manifest folder, which contains all the namespace declerations and everything to run the apps for the cluster. Note this is stored globally, and the two clusters call on specific folders in this manifest to install the apps. This is just my approach to lean toward a DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) paradigm. This enables multiple clusters to re-use the exact same manifests - often using cluster-specific variables to ensure the app is installed in a cluster-specific manner. Not every folder is listed I havent added every folder in here or apps in folder. I'm only breaking out important/unique ones for explanation. Most apps follow the below format, for example the downloads folder/namespace . \u2514\u2500\u2500 downloads/ # (1) \u251c\u2500\u2500 qbittorrent/ # (2) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 config-pvc.yaml # (3) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 helmrelease.yaml # (4) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 kustomization.yaml # (5) \u251c\u2500\u2500 sabnzbd/ # (8) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 config-pvc.yaml # (9) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 helmrelease.yaml # (10) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 kustomization.yaml # (11) \u251c\u2500\u2500 namespace.yaml # (6) \u2514\u2500\u2500 kustomization.yaml # (7) Folder for apps, same as namespace name App folder App persistent volume claim - usually named app_name-config-v1 . The version control v1 allows easy upgrade to pvc's if we want to change sizing. Helm release for app Kustomization, calling the config-pvc.yaml and helmrelease.yaml Namespace resource file Kustomize for namespace only. Note this file, unlike other repos, does not call upon the apps - it only refers to and creates the namespace. App folder App persistent volume claim - usually named app_name-config-v1 . The version control v1 allows easy upgrade to pvc's if we want to change sizing. Helm release for app Kustomization, calling the config-pvc.yaml and helmrelease.yaml Why declare PVC 's independantly We dont rely on the helm chart to generate a PVC for us - we prefer to declare them seperately and definitively. With the normal persistent volume policy of Delete in most persistant storage configs, anytime the PVC is removed the storage system will delete the PV - and any data it contains! So if you make changes to the PVC or delete the helm release - its possible you will lose your data. Specifying a PVC seperatly helps proect agains this. It also allows us to version control the pvc, which Ii useful if we need to change pvc size later. . \u2514\u2500\u2500 manifests/ # folder for all namespaces \u251c\u2500\u2500 cert-manager/ # cert-manager folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base/ # helm-release for \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 certificate/ # cert-manager certificate requests \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 config/ # cert-manager config \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 clusterissuer.yaml # cert-manaager clusterissuer (letsencrypt config) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 prometheusrule.yaml # prometheus monitoring rule for certs \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 secret.sops.yaml # cloudflare api-token secret \u251c\u2500\u2500 databases # namespace for databases (postgresql, maraidb) \u251c\u2500\u2500 default/ # namespace for sidero setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 clusters/ # sidero cluster yaml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 environments/ # sidero environment yaml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 serverclasses/ # sidero serverclass yaml \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 servers/ # sidero server yaml \u251c\u2500\u2500 downloads # downloaders (sabnzbd, qbittorrent, etc) \u251c\u2500\u2500 flux-system/ # flux-system add-ons \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 monitoring/ # prometheus rule & podmonitor for monitoring flux \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 notifications/ # discord & github notifications \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 webhook/ # github webhook to call flux on github push for instant reconciliation \u251c\u2500\u2500 games # game servers (factorio, foundrytts) \u251c\u2500\u2500 home-automation # home automation (hass, nodered, mqtt) \u251c\u2500\u2500 kasten-io/ # kasten-io backup solution \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 k10/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blueprints/ # k10 blueprint yaml (extensions of backup method) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 monitoring/ # prometheus monitoring rules \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 policies/ # k10 policies (backup schedules) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 profiles/ # k10 profiles (backup locations) \u251c\u2500\u2500 kube-system # extra apps for cluster operatorions (CNI, plugins, housekeeping) \u251c\u2500\u2500 cillium # this manifest is applied over the top of the quick-install bootstrap \u251c\u2500\u2500 media # media players/servers (Plex, dizquetv) \u251c\u2500\u2500 network-system # network apps/ingress (metallb, traefik, externaldns) \u251c\u2500\u2500 organizarrs # organizer apps (*arr's) \u251c\u2500\u2500 rook-ceph/ # rook-ceph (distributed storage system) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 add-ons/ # rook-ceph addons (grafana dashboards) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cluster/ # rook-ceph cluster definition \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 operator/ # rook-ceph operator \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 snapshot-controller/ # snapshot controller addon (for kasten snapshots) \u251c\u2500\u2500 security # security apps (vaultwarden, SSO) \u251c\u2500\u2500 services # general service apps (hajimari, joplin-server, syncthing) \u251c\u2500\u2500 sidero-system # sidero system apps (arm64 patch, loadbalancer) \u251c\u2500\u2500 system-monitoring # system monitoring (prometheus, grafana, botkube) \u2514\u2500\u2500 vpn # vpn apps (pod gateway, used for qbittorrent/namespace routing)","title":"Folder Structure"},{"location":"repository/folder-structure/#repository-strucutre","text":"Folder structures are important in many projects, and a repostirory for flux (or just k8s yaml) is no exception.

While many use generic names for servers & clusters, aligning to the 'servers are not pets' doctorine that tools like k8's bring, I still need to get my nerd on with a personal cluster. I got the idea for Hegira from Dan Simmons Hyperion Cantos . It ties into the naming of the sidero cluster (technocore) and in general the theme of AI & Humanity that is portraied in the books Hegira is also defined as a journey especially when undertaken to escape from a dangerous or undesirable situation , a somewhat medieval Latin translation of an Arabic word that can be translated to 'migration' or 'exodus', which actually somewhat fits the journey my homelab has taken over the years.","title":"K8s folder structure - Cluster &amp; Flux bootstrap"},{"location":"repository/folder-structure/#k8s-folder-structure-app-manifests","text":"This lists the manifest folder, which contains all the namespace declerations and everything to run the apps for the cluster. Note this is stored globally, and the two clusters call on specific folders in this manifest to install the apps. This is just my approach to lean toward a DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) paradigm. This enables multiple clusters to re-use the exact same manifests - often using cluster-specific variables to ensure the app is installed in a cluster-specific manner. Not every folder is listed I havent added every folder in here or apps in folder. I'm only breaking out important/unique ones for explanation. Most apps follow the below format, for example the downloads folder/namespace . \u2514\u2500\u2500 downloads/ # (1) \u251c\u2500\u2500 qbittorrent/ # (2) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 config-pvc.yaml # (3) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 helmrelease.yaml # (4) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 kustomization.yaml # (5) \u251c\u2500\u2500 sabnzbd/ # (8) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 config-pvc.yaml # (9) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 helmrelease.yaml # (10) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 kustomization.yaml # (11) \u251c\u2500\u2500 namespace.yaml # (6) \u2514\u2500\u2500 kustomization.yaml # (7) Folder for apps, same as namespace name App folder App persistent volume claim - usually named app_name-config-v1 . The version control v1 allows easy upgrade to pvc's if we want to change sizing. Helm release for app Kustomization, calling the config-pvc.yaml and helmrelease.yaml Namespace resource file Kustomize for namespace only. Note this file, unlike other repos, does not call upon the apps - it only refers to and creates the namespace. App folder App persistent volume claim - usually named app_name-config-v1 . The version control v1 allows easy upgrade to pvc's if we want to change sizing. Helm release for app Kustomization, calling the config-pvc.yaml and helmrelease.yaml Why declare PVC 's independantly We dont rely on the helm chart to generate a PVC for us - we prefer to declare them seperately and definitively. With the normal persistent volume policy of Delete in most persistant storage configs, anytime the PVC is removed the storage system will delete the PV - and any data it contains! So if you make changes to the PVC or delete the helm release - its possible you will lose your data. Specifying a PVC seperatly helps proect agains this. It also allows us to version control the pvc, which Ii useful if we need to change pvc size later. . \u2514\u2500\u2500 manifests/ # folder for all namespaces \u251c\u2500\u2500 cert-manager/ # cert-manager folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base/ # helm-release for \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 certificate/ # cert-manager certificate requests \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 config/ # cert-manager config \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 clusterissuer.yaml # cert-manaager clusterissuer (letsencrypt config) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 prometheusrule.yaml # prometheus monitoring rule for certs \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 secret.sops.yaml # cloudflare api-token secret \u251c\u2500\u2500 databases # namespace for databases (postgresql, maraidb) \u251c\u2500\u2500 default/ # namespace for sidero setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 clusters/ # sidero cluster yaml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 environments/ # sidero environment yaml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 serverclasses/ # sidero serverclass yaml \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 servers/ # sidero server yaml \u251c\u2500\u2500 downloads # downloaders (sabnzbd, qbittorrent, etc) \u251c\u2500\u2500 flux-system/ # flux-system add-ons \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 monitoring/ # prometheus rule & podmonitor for monitoring flux \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 notifications/ # discord & github notifications \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 webhook/ # github webhook to call flux on github push for instant reconciliation \u251c\u2500\u2500 games # game servers (factorio, foundrytts) \u251c\u2500\u2500 home-automation # home automation (hass, nodered, mqtt) \u251c\u2500\u2500 kasten-io/ # kasten-io backup solution \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 k10/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blueprints/ # k10 blueprint yaml (extensions of backup method) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 monitoring/ # prometheus monitoring rules \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 policies/ # k10 policies (backup schedules) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 profiles/ # k10 profiles (backup locations) \u251c\u2500\u2500 kube-system # extra apps for cluster operatorions (CNI, plugins, housekeeping) \u251c\u2500\u2500 cillium # this manifest is applied over the top of the quick-install bootstrap \u251c\u2500\u2500 media # media players/servers (Plex, dizquetv) \u251c\u2500\u2500 network-system # network apps/ingress (metallb, traefik, externaldns) \u251c\u2500\u2500 organizarrs # organizer apps (*arr's) \u251c\u2500\u2500 rook-ceph/ # rook-ceph (distributed storage system) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 add-ons/ # rook-ceph addons (grafana dashboards) \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cluster/ # rook-ceph cluster definition \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 operator/ # rook-ceph operator \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 snapshot-controller/ # snapshot controller addon (for kasten snapshots) \u251c\u2500\u2500 security # security apps (vaultwarden, SSO) \u251c\u2500\u2500 services # general service apps (hajimari, joplin-server, syncthing) \u251c\u2500\u2500 sidero-system # sidero system apps (arm64 patch, loadbalancer) \u251c\u2500\u2500 system-monitoring # system monitoring (prometheus, grafana, botkube) \u2514\u2500\u2500 vpn # vpn apps (pod gateway, used for qbittorrent/namespace routing)","title":"K8s folder structure - App Manifests"},{"location":"repository/semantic-git-messages/","text":"Semantic Commit Messages \u00b6 In this repo, I have made some effort to use semantic commit messaging to be a bit more descriptive/declaritive of what my changes do.
