      ## Server Configuration
      ##
      server:
        ## Buffers usually should be configured to be the same value.
        ## Explanation at https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/server.html
        ## Read buffer size adjusts the server's max incoming request size in bytes.
        ## Write buffer size does the same for outgoing responses.
        read_buffer_size: 4096
        write_buffer_size: 4096
        ## Set the single level path Authelia listens on.
        ## Must be alphanumeric chars and should not contain any slashes.
        path: ""

      ## Level of verbosity for logs: info, debug, trace.
      log_level: debug
      ## Format the logs are written as: json, text.
      log_format: text
      ## TODO: Statefulness check should check if this is set, and the configMap should enable it.
      ## File path where the logs will be written. If not set logs are written to stdout.
      # log_file_path: /config/authelia.log

      ## Default redirection URL
      ##
      ## If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia does not know where to redirect the user to at the end
      ## of the authentication process. This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection URL Authelia will use
      ## in such a case.
      ##
      ## Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't be redirected upon successful authentication.
      ## Default is https://www.<domain> (value at the top of the values.yaml).
      # default_redirection_url: https://example.com

      ##
      ## TOTP Configuration
      ##
      ## Parameters used for TOTP generation
      totp: {}
      # totp:
      ## The issuer name displayed in the Authenticator application of your choice
      ## See: https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format for more info on issuer names
      ## Defaults to <domain>.
      # issuer: authelia.com
      ## The period in seconds a one-time password is current for. Changing this will require all users to register
      ## their TOTP applications again. Warning: before changing period read the docs link below.
      # period: 30
      ## The skew controls number of one-time passwords either side of the current one that are valid.
      ## Warning: before changing skew read the docs link below.
      ## See: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/one-time-password.html#period-and-skew to read the documentation.
      # skew: 1

      ##
      ## Authentication Backend Provider Configuration
      ##
      ## Used for verifying user passwords and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.
      ##
      ## The available providers are: `file`, `ldap`. You must use one and only one of these providers.
      authentication_backend:
        ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality
        disable_reset_password: false

        ## The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend. Uses duration notation.
        ## To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users will
        ## always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
        ## To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
        ## See the below documentation for more information.
        ## Duration Notation docs:  https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
        ## Refresh Interval docs: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/ldap.html#refresh-interval

        ## LDAP backend configuration.
        ##
        ## This backend allows Authelia to be scaled to more
        ## than one instance and therefore is recommended for
        ## production.
        ldap: {}
        # ldap:
        ## The LDAP implementation, this affects elements like the attribute utilised for resetting a password.
        ## Acceptable options are as follows:
        ## - 'activedirectory' - For Microsoft Active Directory.
        ## - 'custom' - For custom specifications of attributes and filters.
        ## This currently defaults to 'custom' to maintain existing behaviour.
        ##
        ## Depending on the option here certain other values in this section have a default value, notably all of the
        ## attribute mappings have a default value that this config overrides, you can read more about these default values
        ## at https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/ldap.html#defaults
        # implementation: custom

        ## The url to the ldap server. Format: <scheme>://<address>[:<port>].
        ## Scheme can be ldap or ldaps in the format (port optional).
        # url: ldap://openldap.default.svc.cluster.local

        ## Use StartTLS with the LDAP connection.
        # start_tls: false

        # tls:
        ## Server Name for certificate validation (in case it's not set correctly in the URL).
        # server_name: ldap.example.com

        ## Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow a self-signed certificate).
        ## In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the public portion of the certificate to the
        ## certificates directory which is defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the config.
        # skip_verify: false

        ## Minimum TLS version for either Secure LDAP or LDAP StartTLS.
        # minimum_version: TLS1.2

        ## The base dn for every LDAP query.
        # base_dn: DC=example,DC=com

        ## The attribute holding the username of the user. This attribute is used to populate the username in the session
        ## information. It was introduced due to #561 to handle case insensitive search queries. For you information,
        ## Microsoft Active Directory usually uses 'sAMAccountName' and OpenLDAP usually uses 'uid'. Beware that this
        ## attribute holds the unique identifiers for the users binding the user and the configuration stored in database.
        ## Therefore only single value attributes are allowed and the value must never be changed once attributed to a user
        ## otherwise it would break the configuration for that user. Technically, non-unique attributes like 'mail' can also
        ## be used but we don't recommend using them, we instead advise to use the attributes mentioned above
        ## (sAMAccountName and uid) to follow https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt.
        # username_attribute: uid

        ## An additional dn to define the scope to all users.
        # additional_users_dn: OU=Users

        ## The users filter used in search queries to find the user profile based on input filled in login form.
        ## Various placeholders are available in the user filter:
        ## - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form.
        ## - {username_attribute} is a mandatory placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
        ## - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
        ## - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later
        ##   versions, so please don't use it.
        ##
        ## Recommended settings are as follows:
        ## - Microsoft Active Directory: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))
        ## - OpenLDAP:
        ##   - (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))
        ##   - (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))
        ##
        ## To allow sign in both with username and email, one can use a filter like
        ## (&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))
        # users_filter: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))

        ## An additional dn to define the scope of groups.
        # additional_groups_dn: OU=Groups

        ## The groups filter used in search queries to find the groups of the user.
        ## - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form.
        ## - {username} is a placeholder replace by the username stored in LDAP (based on `username_attribute`).
        ## - {dn} is a matcher replaced by the user distinguished name, aka, user DN.
        ## - {username_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
        ## - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
        ## - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later
        ##   versions, so please don't use it.
        ## - DON'T USE - {1} is an alias for {username} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in
        ##   later version, so please don't use it.
        ##
        ## If your groups use the `groupOfUniqueNames` structure use this instead:
        ##    (&(uniquemember={dn})(objectclass=groupOfUniqueNames))
        # groups_filter: (&(member={dn})(objectclass=groupOfNames))

        ## The attribute holding the name of the group
        # group_name_attribute: cn

        ## The attribute holding the mail address of the user. If multiple email addresses are defined for a user, only the
        ## first one returned by the LDAP server is used.
        # mail_attribute: mail

        ## The attribute holding the display name of the user. This will be used to greet an authenticated user.
        # display_name_attribute: displayname

        ## The username of the admin user.
        # user: CN=Authelia,DC=example,DC=com

        ##
        ## File (Authentication Provider)
        ##
        ## With this backend, the users database is stored in a file which is updated when users reset their passwords.
        ## Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment and not in production since it prevents Authelia
        ## to be scaled to more than one instance. The options under 'password' have sane defaults, and as it has security
        ## implications it is highly recommended you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings
        ## please read the docs page below:
        ## https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/file.html#password-hash-algorithm-tuning
        ##

      ##
      ## Access Control Configuration
      ##
      ## Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one resource to users or group of users.
      ##
      ## If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass' rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed
      ## to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow the rules defined.
      ##
      ## Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
      ## It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
      ##
      ## Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML to be syntactically correct.
      ##
      ## Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject', 'policy' and 'resources'.
      ##
      ## - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
      ##
      ## - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is optional and matching any user if not
      ##    provided. If provided, the parameter represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form
      ##    'user:<username>' or 'group:<groupname>'.
      ##
      ## - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
      ##
      ## - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to apply the policy to. This parameter
      ##   is optional and matches any resource if not provided.
      ##
      ## Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching (domain, resource, subject) applies.
      access_control:
        ## Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'. It is the policy applied to any
        ## resource if there is no policy to be applied to the user.
        default_policy: deny

      ##
      ## Session Provider Configuration
      ##
      ## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
      ## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
      session:
        ## The name of the session cookie. (default: authelia_session).
        name: authelia_session

        ## The time in seconds before the cookie expires and session is reset.
        expiration: 1h

        ## The inactivity time in seconds before the session is reset.
        inactivity: 5m

        ## The remember me duration.
        ## Value is in seconds, or duration notation. Value of 0 disables remember me.
        ## See: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
        ## Longer periods are considered less secure because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to
        ## spy or attack. Currently the default is 1M or 1 month.
        remember_me_duration: 1M

      ## Notification Provider
      ##
      ##
      ## Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a u2f registration or a TOTP registration.
      ## The available providers are: filesystem, smtp. You must use one and only one of these providers.
      notifier:
        ## You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
        disable_startup_check: false

        ##
        ## File System (Notification Provider)
        ##
        ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/statelessness.html
        ##
        filesystem:
          filename: /config/notification.txt

        ##
        ## SMTP (Notification Provider)
        ##
        ## Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses the PLAIN or LOGIN methods to authenticate.
        ## [Security] By default Authelia will:
        ##   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
        ##      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement
        ##        (only works for unauthenticated connections)
        ##   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
        ##     (configure in tls section)
        # smtp:
        # username: test
        # host: smtp.mail.svc.cluster.local
        # port: 25
        # sender: admin@example.com
        ## HELO/EHLO Identifier. Some SMTP Servers may reject the default of localhost.
        # identifier: localhost
        ## Subject configuration of the emails sent.
        ## {title} is replaced by the text from the notifier
        # subject: "[Authelia] {title}"
        ## This address is used during the startup check to verify the email configuration is correct.
        ## It's not important what it is except if your email server only allows local delivery.
        # startup_check_address: test@authelia.com
        # disable_require_tls: false
        # disable_html_emails: false
        # tls:
        ## Server Name for certificate validation (in case you are using the IP or non-FQDN in the host option).
        # server_name: smtp.example.com
        ## Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow a self-signed certificate).
        ## In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the public portion of the certificate to the
        ## certificates directory which is defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the config.
        # skip_verify: false
        ## Minimum TLS version for either StartTLS or SMTPS.
        # minimum_version: TLS1.2

    ## Authelia Secret Generator.
    ##
    ## If both the values and existingSecret are not defined, this chart randomly generates a new secret on each
    ## install. It is recommended that you use something like sealed-secrets (https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
    ## and use the existingSecrets. All secrets can be stored in a single k8s secret if desired using the key option.

    ## Authelia Persistence Configuration.
    ##
    ## Useful in scenarios where you need persistent storage.
    ## Auth Provider Use Case: file; we recommend you use the ldap provider instead.
    ## Storage Provider Use Case: local; we recommend you use the mysql/mariadb or postgres provider instead.
    ## Configuration Use Case: when you want to manually configure the configuration entirely (set configMap.enabled = false).
