      # OpenID configuration will allow users to authenticate through a third-party OpenID Connect compatible provider.
      # The provider needs to support the `openid`, `profile` and `email` scopes.
      # **Note:** Some openid providers (like gitlab) only make the email of the user available through openid claims if they have set it to be publicly visible.
      # If the email is not public in those cases, authenticating will fail.
      # **Note 2:** The frontend expects to be redirected after authentication by the third party
      # to <frontend-url>/auth/openid/<auth key>. Please make sure to configure the redirect url with your third party
      # auth service accordingly if you're using the default Vikunja frontend.
      # Take a look at the [default config file](https://kolaente.dev/vikunja/api/src/branch/main/config.yml.sample) for more information about how to configure openid authentication.
